# Progress

## Done

- Documentation-only repository setup.
- Agent rules, planning record, decision log, and GitHub templates prepared.
- Stack-neutral agent roles, hooks, and planning/tracing workflows prepared.
- Agent-first delivery, branch naming, and progress-tracking policies recorded.
- Private GitHub repository created and configured as `origin`; the initial
  governance and planning branches were pushed. Later planning changes are
  currently local and unpushed.
- Master delivery plan revised: core reconstruction first; compiler next; MCP,
  cloud services, and proposal extensions afterward.
- Core architecture constraints for future MCP and built-in-agent support
  recorded before implementation begins.
- IDE work explicitly deferred beyond core parity, compiler, known extras, and
  future owner-selected expansion.
- Mandatory catalog and progress-update rules recorded for every capability
  change and handoff.
- Phase 0 direction approved pending a bounded renderer/memory benchmark:
  Electron + React + TypeScript, Windows-first testing, early macOS/Linux
  launch checks, renderer-independent document/command model, and TSX/Tailwind
  compiler contract.
- Memory efficiency elevated to a product requirement and future release gate.
- Repository stays private until the main Illustrator/compiler project is
  complete; no visibility change is authorized before then.
- Independent architecture review conditionally supports Electron, subject to
  the renderer/memory benchmark; no benchmark measurement or platform launch
  has been completed.
- Parity catalog v1 created with stable capability IDs, status definitions,
  minimum acceptance behavior, compiler support states, and the first proposed
  implementation slice.
- Phase 0 planning, catalog, and the benchmark harness were consolidated into
  `main`; Phase 0 itself remains open until the blocked benchmark produces
  evidence for the Electron/SVG decision.
- Benchmark harness started on `chore/renderer-memory-benchmark`: source test
  and UI production build pass. An initial Electron Builder runtime-packaging
  stall was repaired before the packaged Windows evidence run.
- Packaging was repaired and five packaged Windows synthetic-renderer runs
  completed. They show full-document SVG misses the stress interaction target;
  they do not verify real edited-document save/reopen, undo/redo, or recovery.
- Tauri comparison setup reached Rust, WebView2, Vite, and Cargo dependency
  compilation. It cannot yet produce an executable because the benchmark
  machine has no MSVC `link.exe`; two approved Build Tools installation attempts
  exited without registering Build Tools or installing that linker.
- Phase 0 platform decision completed after independent review: Electron +
  React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite is the development baseline; the
  full-document SVG renderer is rejected. CanvasKit/Skia is the next renderer
  candidate and must pass a bounded measured spike before editor work.

## Next

- Execute Phase 1 Slice 1: CanvasKit/Skia renderer spike and its memory/lifecycle
  acceptance evidence.

## Known issues

- No production editor code or GitHub labels exist yet.
- Graphify is installed, but no knowledge graph exists until source code is added.
- Full-document SVG misses the stress interaction target. CanvasKit/Skia is
  unproven until its renderer spike passes the same workload.
- The current Windows benchmark machine lacks the MSVC linker required to
  compile Tauri. Its comparison is deferred and non-blocking; the temporary
  harness and dependencies are outside the repo.
