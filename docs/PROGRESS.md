# Progress

## Done

- Documentation-only repository setup.
- Agent rules, planning record, decision log, and GitHub templates prepared.
- Stack-neutral agent roles, hooks, and planning/tracing workflows prepared.
- Agent-first delivery, branch naming, and progress-tracking policies recorded.
- Private GitHub repository created and configured as `origin`; the initial
  governance and planning branches were pushed. Later planning changes are
  currently local and unpushed.
- Master delivery plan revised: core reconstruction first; compiler next; MCP,
  cloud services, and proposal extensions afterward.
- Core architecture constraints for future MCP and built-in-agent support
  recorded before implementation begins.
- IDE work explicitly deferred beyond core parity, compiler, known extras, and
  future owner-selected expansion.
- Mandatory catalog and progress-update rules recorded for every capability
  change and handoff.
- Phase 0 direction approved pending a bounded renderer/memory benchmark:
  Electron + React + TypeScript, Windows-first testing, early macOS/Linux
  launch checks, renderer-independent document/command model, and TSX/Tailwind
  compiler contract.
- Memory efficiency elevated to a product requirement and future release gate.
- Repository stays private until the main Illustrator/compiler project is
  complete; no visibility change is authorized before then.
- Independent architecture review conditionally supports Electron, subject to
  the renderer/memory benchmark; no benchmark measurement or platform launch
  has been completed.
- Parity catalog v1 created with stable capability IDs, status definitions,
  minimum acceptance behavior, compiler support states, and the first proposed
  implementation slice.
- Phase 0 planning, catalog, and the benchmark harness were consolidated into
  `main`; Phase 0 itself remains open until the blocked benchmark produces
  evidence for the Electron/SVG decision.
- Benchmark harness started on `chore/renderer-memory-benchmark`: source test
  and UI production build pass. An initial Electron Builder runtime-packaging
  stall was repaired before the packaged Windows evidence run.
- Packaging was repaired and the five-run packaged Windows benchmark completed.
  SVG fails the stress performance target; Electron remains unapproved pending
  the same benchmark on Tauri because its empty working set exceeds the
  proposed memory target.

## Next

- Run the same fixture set on Tauri, then lock the desktop-shell and renderer
  decisions from the comparison evidence.
- Write and approve the first feature plan from the parity catalog.

## Known issues

- No production editor code, packaged benchmark executable, measured renderer
  result, or GitHub labels exist yet.
- Graphify is installed, but no knowledge graph exists until source code is added.
- Electron's empty working set exceeds the proposed target, and SVG misses the
  stress interaction target; Tauri comparison evidence is required before the
  desktop shell can be locked.
