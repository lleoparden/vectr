# Progress

## Done

- Documentation-only repository setup.
- Agent rules, planning record, decision log, and GitHub templates prepared.
- Stack-neutral agent roles, hooks, and planning/tracing workflows prepared.
- Agent-first delivery, branch naming, and progress-tracking policies recorded.
- Private GitHub repository created and configured as `origin`; the initial
  governance and planning branches were pushed. Later planning changes are
  currently local and unpushed.
- Master delivery plan revised: core reconstruction first; compiler next; MCP,
  cloud services, and proposal extensions afterward.
- Core architecture constraints for future MCP and built-in-agent support
  recorded before implementation begins.
- IDE work explicitly deferred beyond core parity, compiler, known extras, and
  future owner-selected expansion.
- Mandatory catalog and progress-update rules recorded for every capability
  change and handoff.
- Phase 0 direction approved pending a bounded renderer/memory benchmark:
  Electron + React + TypeScript, Windows-first testing, early macOS/Linux
  launch checks, renderer-independent document/command model, and TSX/Tailwind
  compiler contract.
- Memory efficiency elevated to a product requirement and future release gate.
- Repository stays private until the main Illustrator/compiler project is
  complete; no visibility change is authorized before then.
- Independent architecture review conditionally supports Electron, subject to
  the renderer/memory benchmark; no benchmark measurement or platform launch
  has been completed.
- Parity catalog v1 created with stable capability IDs, status definitions,
  minimum acceptance behavior, compiler support states, and the first proposed
  implementation slice.
- Phase 0 planning, catalog, and the benchmark harness were consolidated into
  `main`; Phase 0 itself remains open until the blocked benchmark produces
  evidence for the Electron/SVG decision.
- Benchmark harness started on `chore/renderer-memory-benchmark`: source test
  and UI production build pass. An initial Electron Builder runtime-packaging
  stall was repaired before the packaged Windows evidence run.
- Packaging was repaired and five packaged Windows synthetic-renderer runs
  completed. They show full-document SVG misses the stress interaction target;
  they do not verify real edited-document save/reopen, undo/redo, or recovery.
- Tauri comparison setup reached Rust, WebView2, Vite, and Cargo dependency
  compilation. It cannot yet produce an executable because the benchmark
  machine has no MSVC `link.exe`; two approved Build Tools installation attempts
  exited without registering Build Tools or installing that linker.
- Phase 0 platform decision completed after independent review: Electron +
  React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite is the development baseline; the
  full-document SVG renderer is rejected. CanvasKit/Skia is the next renderer
  candidate and must pass a bounded measured spike before editor work.
- Agent completion rule added: owner review/testing happens only after agents
  complete the approved outcome and their planned validation.
- Issue and pull-request workflow adopted (PR #21): every phase owns an epic
  issue created up front (#1–#14), sub-issues are generated when a phase starts,
  agents choose the phase's pull-request strategy, and the owner reviews, tests,
  and decides every merge. Phase 1 sub-issues #15–#20 are linked to epic #3.
- Tailwind installed as approved; `npm run typecheck` added; the Phase 0 harness
  identity is scheduled to move to the Vectr app identity in slice 2.
- Phase 1 slice 1 delivered (issue #15, branch `feat/canvaskit-renderer-spike`):
  frozen document-shaped fixtures for primitives, text, images, and nested groups
  at empty/representative/stress sizes; a WebGL CanvasKit renderer with retained
  objects, shared content-addressed fixture assets, and explicit disposal; a
  defined interaction methodology; and five packaged runs recorded in
  `.ecc/benchmarks/phase-one/`.
- Bundled Inter (SIL OFL 1.1, license included) because `canvaskit-wasm@0.42`
  exposes only `FontMgr.FromData` and no system font manager.
- Renderer spike verdict: **FAIL** — worst stress interaction p95 99.9 ms against
  the retained 33 ms target, with draw submission alone at 74.6 ms. Leak check
  passed (retained paths/images/paragraphs returned to zero after 10
  build/draw/release cycles); peak whole-app working set 817 MiB, private bytes
  995 MiB, GPU process 280 MiB across four processes. Full numbers and the gate
  definition are in `docs/PARITY_CATALOG.md` ("Renderer evidence (PERF-01)").
- Phase 1 slice 1b delivered (issue #23, branch `enhance/renderer-picture-replay`):
  a recorded-picture draw path (at most 16 Skia pictures over buckets of
  consecutive top-level roots), per-bucket invalidation for edits, cached paints
  with batch eviction, an edit scenario in the suite, per-mode verdicts, and a
  `--directory=`/`--contents=` runner for scoped evidence runs and quick checks.
  Renderer diagnostics now forward to stdout so a failed or hung run is visible.
- Optimization verdict: still **FAIL**, but the worst stress interaction dropped
  from 99.9 ms to 82.2 ms across five packaged runs. Nested groups at 10,000
  leaves now pass (34.8 → 21.4 ms), text at 1,000 nodes 32.2 → 12.4 ms, images
  3.6 → 2.5 ms, 1,000 primitives 7.5 → 7.3 ms. Text at 10,000 nodes is marginal
  (35.0 ms); 10,000 loose primitives remain the failing case. The remaining cost
  is GPU-side per-draw overhead across roughly 20,000 anti-aliased path draws per
  frame, not JS-to-WASM work. Edit cost (re-record one bucket): 1–7 ms at 1,000
  nodes, 22 ms at 10,000 text nodes, 54–61 ms at 10,000 loose primitives. Leak
  check passed in both modes; peak whole-app working set 861 MiB across four
  processes.
- The workflow and renderer stack merged into `main`: #21 (workflow), #22 (slice 1,
  `8c8f72c`), #24 (slice 1b, `325508e`), #26 (slice 1c comparison, `601c32e`), and
  #27 (small-vs-big merge policy plus mandatory self-review, `c0613de`).
- Phase 1 slice 2 delivered (issue #18, branch `feat/document-command-core`):
  versioned document model with structural sharing (`src/doc/types.ts`,
  `document.ts`), stable rejection codes (`validate.ts`), one validated command
  path with inverse commands (`commands.ts`), bounded history with single-entry
  drag transactions (`history.ts`), pure hit testing (`hitTest.ts`), a
  paint-order scene builder (`src/render/scene.ts`), the editor renderer on the
  accepted recorded-picture path with per-bucket invalidation
  (`src/render/EditorRenderer.ts`), the editor store with one `dispatch` entry
  point (`src/state/documentStore.ts`), and the editor shell (toolbar, canvas with
  rect/ellipse tools, marquee, drag transactions, zoom/pan, layer list, shortcuts).
- The app identity is now `vectr` / `Vectr` / `com.vectr.app`, the benchmark
  runner targets `Vectr.exe`, and the Phase 1 benchmark harness stays reachable
  with `?benchmark` inside the same app.
- Slice 2 evidence: `electron . --smoke=stress` passes all nine command-path steps
  and measures 1,001 shapes in 16 recorded buckets at **render p95 1.10 ms** over
  60 frames (scene build 4.4 ms), with 48 unit tests passing and clean typecheck
  and build.
- Bugs found and fixed while building the slice: `replaceNode` never matched the
  document root (root-level inserts silently did nothing); `History` used a
  TypeScript parameter property that Node strip-only mode rejects; a locked group
  did not lock its subtree in hit testing; and a PowerShell rewrite of
  `package.json` added a UTF-8 BOM that broke the Vite build.
- Phase 1 slice 2b, the UI shell alignment (issue #28, branch
  `feat/ui-shell-alignment`, stacked on #18): the shell is now a modern Illustrator
  rather than a placeholder — menu bar with Illustrator's menu structure
  (`src/app/MenuBar.tsx`, `menuModel.ts`), docked left tool palette with V/M/L and
  original icons (`ToolPalette.tsx`, `icons.tsx`), right panel dock with collapsible
  tabbed groups (`src/app/panels/PanelDock.tsx`), Layers panel with disclosure, eye,
  lock, and a reserved thumbnail slot (`panels/LayersPanel.tsx`), read-only
  Properties, Appearance, and Color panels, status bar, theme tokens
  (`src/styles.css` `@theme` plus `src/app/theme.ts`), one action table shared by
  menus, palette, and keyboard (`src/app/actions.ts`), an Illustrator-default
  shortcut map (`src/app/shortcuts.ts`), pure viewport arithmetic
  (`src/app/viewportOps.ts`), and workspace state split out of the document store
  (`src/state/workspaceStore.ts`) so layout changes stop waking document subscribers.
- Slice 2b evidence: `electron . --smoke=stress` passes all nine command-path steps on
  the new shell and measures 1,001 shapes in 16 recorded buckets at **render p95
  1.10 ms** over 60 frames (scene build 3.5 ms), WebGL; 64 unit tests pass (16 new
  shell tests) with clean typecheck and build.
- Slice 2b bug found and fixed by the new tests: Hide/Lock over several selected nodes
  first shared one transaction, and a transaction keeps only the first inverse, so
  undo restored one layer and left the others hidden. Flag changes now record one
  entry per node, and the aggregate-inverse fix is logged as a follow-up instead of
  changing the command model inside a UI slice.

## Next

- **Renderer gate amended by measurement (issue #25).** A candidate comparison ran
  end to end with criteria frozen before measurement, five packaged runs per
  candidate, on the same fixtures and protocol:
  - CanvasKit recorded-picture: 1,000 live layers 5.7 ms (pass), 10,000-leaf nested
    groups 19.2 ms (pass), 10,000 loose primitives 89.8 ms (**fail**); peak working
    set 861 MiB with a 271 MiB GPU process.
  - `vello_cpu` 0.3.0 built for wasm32 with SIMD128 (VectorCraft's rasterizer):
    1,000 live layers 8.3 ms (pass), 10,000-leaf groups 39.3 ms (fail), 10,000 loose
    primitives 125.6 ms (**fail**); peak working set 727 MiB; leak-clean.
  - VectorCraft's own native bench on this machine: 37.2 ms for 20,000 simpler
    shapes at 2880×1800 with worker threads (their README claims ~27 ms).
  - Not measured, not claimed: resvg-wasm/tiny-skia and CanvasKit WebGPU.
  - Outcome: no measured candidate meets 33 ms on 10,000 loose always-visible
    primitives, so the gate is **amended, not met**; CanvasKit recorded-picture is
    accepted with published limits and `PERF-01` stays open with revisit triggers.
    Evidence: `.ecc/benchmarks/renderer-comparison/`.

## Next

- **Owner action: review and merge PR #30** (Phase 1 slice 2, issue #18 — versioned
  document, validated command path, bounded undo/redo, editor store, renderer, and
  the original editor shell). It is classified big: it sets the command/undo model,
  the app identity, and the interfaces slices 3–6 build on. Merged already: #21, #22,
  #24, #26, #27, #29, #31, #32.
- **Then review and merge the UI shell alignment** (issue #28, PR stacked on #30):
  it is the shell Phase 2 builds on, so it lands before any new tool. `UI-01` stays
  `building` while the read-only panels, the unbuilt workspace layer, and the
  per-node undo aggregation remain.
- After that, Phase 1 continues in order: #20 (layers and groups: interactive tree,
  reorder, group/ungroup, rename, the aggregate-inverse question), #16 (plain text),
  #17 (images), #19 (durable local documents, which also retires the missing File
  menu).
- Known follow-up worth an owner decision before #20: whether the command model grows
  an aggregate inverse so a multi-object Hide or Lock is one undo step, as it is in
  Illustrator.
- **UI direction recorded and enforced (PRs #29 and #31).** Vectr's interface is a
  modern Illustrator (`AGENTS.md`, Product identity; `docs/DECISIONS.md`, 2026-10-14;
  catalog `UI-01`). Interface work must state its Illustrator mapping in its issue and
  pull request, divergence needs a recorded reason, and Adobe or VectorCraft assets,
  screenshots, or branding are never used.
- Issue #28 owns the shell alignment (menu bar, left tool palette, right panel dock,
  theme tokens, Illustrator-default shortcuts) and must land before Phase 2 adds
  tools, so no tool is built twice. Issue #20 must build the Illustrator-style Layers
  panel, docked in the same layout, with per-row visibility and lock.
- After #18 merges, Phase 1 continues in order: #20 (layers and groups), #16 (plain
  text), #17 (images), #19 (durable local documents) — one branch and one pull
  request each, with the UI mapping recorded for the slices that have an interface.
- `PERF-01` revisit triggers: wasm threads with COOP/COEP isolation, Phase 4
  profiling with culling and retained regions on realistic documents, or an
  owner-approved revision of the 10,000-loose-primitive limit.

## Known issues

- No automated end-to-end test covers the GUI. The editor smoke run
  (`electron . --smoke=stress`) is the current evidence path; a GUI test harness is
  an open choice.
- Graphify is installed, but no knowledge graph exists until source code is added.
- The layer list is read-only until #20: reorder, group/ungroup, multi-select, and
  nesting are not interactive yet.
- `cornerRadius` is in the document model but a rectangle still draws with square
  corners until a later slice adds rounded-rect rendering.
- Nothing is persisted yet: the document lives in memory until #19 adds new/open/
  save with a versioned manifest and asset directory.
- Full-document SVG misses the stress interaction target. CanvasKit is measured and
  the accepted recorded-picture path is inside budget up to 1,000 live layers, but
  10,000 loose always-visible primitives remain a published limit (`PERF-01`).
- CanvasKit raises the measured peak whole-app working set to 817 MiB on the
  combined fixture run (four processes, GPU process 280 MiB), so the shell memory
  question stays open alongside the renderer decision.
- The deferred Tauri comparison still cannot build on this machine (no MSVC linker);
  it is non-blocking and the temporary harness sits outside the repo.
- `.ecc/tmp/*` scratch files and `.ecc/issues/*.md` (issue bodies used for creation)
  remain untracked working files.
- The shell now follows the UI direction, but with nineteen recorded divergences from
  Illustrator (`docs/DECISIONS.md`, UI shell alignment). The load-bearing ones:
  Properties, Appearance, and Color are read-only because style and transform commands
  do not exist yet; the Layers panel is read-only beyond selection, hide, lock, and
  disclosure (issue #20 owns the interactive tree, renaming, and thumbnails); the File
  menu is absent until #19 adds documents; Hide/Lock/Show All/Unlock All record one
  history entry per node instead of one per command, because aggregating needs an
  aggregate inverse in the command model; and there are no context menus, rulers,
  guides, or saved workspaces.
